- 👋 Hi, I’m Yudong He
- 👀 I’m interested in digital signal processing, especially blind source separation, or known as cocktail party problem.
- 🌱 I have obtained a bachelor's degree in physics from the University of Science and Technology of China (USTC) in 2017. I’m currently pursuing my PhD at Hong Kong University of Science and Technology (HKUST).
- 💞️ I plan to graduate in summer 2022 and work as a postdoc at HKUST for one year. I look forward to finding a faculty or postdoc position in summer 2023.
